                        I’m Natnael, a driven Computer Science student and tech founder with a strong passion for building impactful solutions. 
                        I’ve worked across software development, education, and entrepreneurship, founding an online academy that has supported hundreds of students, 
                        leading student organizations, and building digital products for real users. 
                        I’m especially interested in the intersection of engineering, technology, and problem-solving, and 
                        I enjoy turning ideas into practical, well-designed systems that create real value.
